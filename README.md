# Conceptual Reflection 
What changed in the internal representation of Point? 
From Attributes to Objects, the class point likely stored in x and y as primitive floats.  And refactor as geometry. In this laboratory before self.x = 121.0  after self.geometry in object format.  
What did not change n the external behavior? 
In this laboratory the ShapelyPoint object still types the exact same line of code p=Point ('A", 121.0, 14.6) the result still provides an ID, Lat and Long
Where does spatial computation now live?
Due to the Geometry Engine spatial computation lived directly. The geometry attribute handles the "math logic."
